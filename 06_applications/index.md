# Applications

Practical implementation patterns and example systems that demonstrate how concepts from modeling, software engineering, ML engineering, and AI engineering are applied in practice.

> How are models and ML/AI systems implemented in real code and real architectures?

This layer contains **implementation-oriented examples**, not theory or project work.

It serves as a bridge between:

- conceptual knowledge (→ `01_foundations`, `02_modeling`)
- engineering systems (→ `03_software_engineering`, `04_ml_engineering`, `05_ai_engineering`)
- real production projects (→ `07_projects`)

The goal is to build a **library of reusable implementation patterns** that can be referenced when designing or implementing real systems.

This layer does NOT cover:
- mathematical derivations (→ `01_foundations`)
- model theory and algorithm design (→ `02_modeling`)
- engineering principles and system architecture patterns (→ `03_software_engineering`, `04_ml_engineering`, `05_ai_engineering`)
- project-specific work (→ `07_projects`)

## Implementation Patterns

### [[06_applications/01_model_implementations/index|01 — Model Implementations]]
Practical implementations of machine learning and deep learning models.

Examples include:
- implementing GMM clustering with sklearn
- training tree ensembles with XGBoost
- dimensionality reduction with PCA
- transformer fine-tuning with PyTorch

These examples connect **model theory** (→ `02_modeling`) with **real code and libraries**.

---

### [[06_applications/02_system_patterns/index|02 — System Patterns]]
Reusable system-level patterns for building ML and AI systems.

Examples include:
- training pipelines
- feature stores
- model serving APIs
- model monitoring systems
- RAG pipelines
- vector database retrieval architectures

These examples demonstrate how concepts from:

- `03_software_engineering`
- `04_ml_engineering`
- `05_ai_engineering`

are implemented in practice.

---

### [[06_applications/03_end_to_end_examples/index|03 — End-to-End Examples]]
Small complete ML/AI systems that combine modeling and engineering concepts.

Examples include:
- churn prediction pipeline
- recommendation system architecture
- anomaly detection pipeline
- document question-answering system using RAG

These examples show **how multiple layers combine to form a working system**.

They serve as reference architectures that can be adapted for real projects.

## Role in the Vault

This layer forms the **implementation bridge** of the knowledge stack:

```
01_foundations

03_software_engineering  
04_ml_engineering  
05_ai_engineering

```


- **Modeling layers** explain *what the methods are*.
- **Engineering layers** explain *how systems should be designed*.
- **Applications** demonstrate *how they are implemented in practice*.
- **Projects** contain *real-world implementations*.
